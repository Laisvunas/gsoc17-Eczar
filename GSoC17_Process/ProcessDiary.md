## gsoc17-Eczar Process Diary


**June 05**
- Initial designs for Regular & Extra-Bold
- First glyphs added: /alpha /eta /iota /omicron /rho
- **Interpolation tests:**
based on the original design of Eczar, and according to the /n stems of Regular & Extra Bold,
one can get the interpolation factor with some simple math:

   for i in [0, max]

   n(i+1) = n(i) + (n(max)-n(i)) * factor

   Initial designs examples for some of the Greek glyphs (awaiting feedback from mentor):
