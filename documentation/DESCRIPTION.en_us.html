Eczar is an open-source type family published by Rosetta with generous financial support from Google. 
The family currently has 5 weights.
</p>
<p>
Eczar supports over 45 languages in Latin and 3 in Devanagari script (Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali).
</p>
The project design and production was done in-house. Design by Vaibhav Singh, code and production by David Březina. Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance, both at text sizes and in display settings.

The Eczar project is led by Rosetta, world-typography specialist and font publisher based in Europe.
