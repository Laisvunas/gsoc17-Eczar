# Eczar brief

Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari â€“ with the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for headlines and display purposes.

The family includes 5 weights in upright style.
