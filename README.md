Eczar
=====

Type family **Eczar** designed by Vaibhav Singh (@errorsinc), produced by David Březina (@MrBrezina) and published by [Rosetta Type Foundry](https://www.rosettatype.com) and Google. 

Eczar started as a student project in 2010–11 during Vaibhav’s MA studies in Typeface Design at the University of Reading. Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for headlines and display purposes.
The family includes 5 weights in upright style. The final version will support following languages.

In **Devanagari** script: standard modern Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali.

In **Latin** script (Adobe Latin 2 character set): major Western European Latin languages as well as Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, Finnish, French, Gaelic, German, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Javanese(Latin), Malay(Latin), Norwegian, Portuguese, Sami(Southern), Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, and Walloon.

The repo contains sources for [Glyphs](http://glyphsapp.com), TrueType-flavoured OpenType `.ttf` and PostScript-flavoured OpenType `.otf` font files. The UFO files are a derived source, exported from Glyphs. They are provided as is.
