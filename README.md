## Synopsis

This project aims to bring **full support for the Greek script, including polytonic** for the typeface **Eczar**.

Eczar is an open-source type family designed by Vaibhav Singh, produced by David Březina, and published by [Rosetta Type Foundry](https://rosettatype.com).
You can view the original Github repository of the project [here](https://github.com/rosettatype/Eczar) and the fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Eczar).

As a typeface, Eczar has a strong personality, with five weights from Regular to Extra-Bold and can be used to set text from body copy to display.
At the moment, not many Serif fonts that support Greek are available from Google Fonts; the goal of this project is to expand this collection.

Eczar already supports Latin and Devanagari. Devanagari are designed with an axis mirrored in relation to the Latin; this provides a good basis for certain letterforms that could be transferred into the Greek design, rendering a balanced outcome for all the supported scripts.
