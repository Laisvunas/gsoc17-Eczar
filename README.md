# Eczar

**Eczar** is an open-source type family published by [Rosetta](https://rosettatype.com) with generous financial support from Google. The fonts support over 45+3 languages in Latin and Devanagari scripts in 5 weights. It was designed by Vaibhav Singh ([@errorsinc](http://github.com/errorsinc)), code and production is by [David Březina](http://davi.cz) ([@MrBrezina](http://github.com/MrBrezina)).


Eczar started as a student project in 2010–11 during Vaibhav’s MA studies in Typeface Design at the University of Reading. Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for headlines and display purposes.
